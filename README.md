# ClusteringGalaxies
This is a project to perform clustering techniques in a dataset formed by pictures of galaxies.

Dataset: https://astro.utoronto.ca/~hleung/shared/Galaxy10/Galaxy10_DECals.h5 or import it from astroNN.datasets load_galaxy10

**About the Galaxy10 DECals Dataset:** The original Galaxy10 dataset was created with Galaxy Zoo (GZ) Data Release 2 where volunteers classify ~270k of SDSS galaxy images where ~22k of those images were selected in 10 broad classes using volunteer votes. GZ later utilized images from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DECals) with much better resolution and image quality. Galaxy10 DECals has combined all three (GZ DR2 with DECals images instead of SDSS images and DECals campaign ab, c) results in ~441k of unique galaxies covered by DECals where ~18k of those images were selected in 10 broad classes using volunteer votes with more rigorous filtering. Galaxy10 DECals had its 10 broad classes tweaked a bit so that each class is more distinct from each other and Edge-on Disk with Boxy Bulge class with only 17 images in original Galaxy10 was abandoned.
